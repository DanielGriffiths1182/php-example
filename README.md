# PHP get continent from user input, 2 hour excersize
*Daniel Griffiths PHP Example* 

- *IMPORTANT: Wanted to find API for address verifications through API calls, then GET the continent/other relevant data from user input - but found none during the 2 hour time*

- *Instead, we are taking an array of (country=>continent) objects and matching based on user input, this is not ideal*

- *at best we could use a 3rd party API - or, build a little database ourselves so that we don't have to deal with an array in countries.php*

- *Built a basic form, handling input from the user and printing the full address plus continent below*

- *Added a little style sheet, but didn't do much since it was getting late in the evening*

- *signed up for Heroku and debugged the issues during deployment*

# Instructions

2. Enter your address, make sure to meet the validations
3. Select submit, and see the returned address with continent
