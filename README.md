# php-example | Address Form
*Daniel Griffiths PHP Example* 

## 2 hour process ##
- *IMPORTANT: Wanted to find an API so I could do address verifications through API calls, and GET the continent/other relevant data from user input - but I couldn't find one*

- *Since I couldn't find an API to do that, I am doing something I don't want to do. I am taking an array of (country=>continent) objects and matching based on user input*

- *If I was working on this for a longer period of time I would find an API for this, at best - or at worst, build a little database so that I don't have to deal with a huge array in my index.php*

- *Built a basic form, handling input from the user and printing the full address plus continent below*

- *Added a little style sheet, but didn't do much since it was getting late in the evening*

- *singed up for heroku, debugged the issues I had at deployment*

## If I spent more time revisiting
- *build database, or find API for address work - this would enable a cleaner form for user experience as well as code*
- *spend some time on styles - button is done, but lots of little issues that would be nice to resolve*
- *possibly OOP structure, rather than procedural*

# Instructions
